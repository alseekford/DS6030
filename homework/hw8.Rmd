# Problem 8: Kaggle 

We have officially ended our coverage of supervised learning. Let's cap it off with a Kaggle contest. 

You are to make at least one official entry in the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) Kaggle contest. 

- You will need to register in Kaggle (its free)
- Read the details of the contest. Understand the data and evaluation function.
- Make at least one submission
- If you get a score on the public leaderboard of $\text{RMSE}<0.50$ (note RMSE is calculated on the log scale), you receive full credit, otherwise, you'll lose 10 points. 
    - I'll allow [teaming](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/team) to achieve the score, but only if everyone on the team produces a model that is used to generate the final submission (e.g., stacking or model averaging)
- Submit the following in Collab (everyone needs to submit in collab):
    - Code that you contributed (one person per team should submit the code used to make submission)
    - kaggle name (or team name) so we can ensure you had a valid submission. 
    - your score and current ranking on the kaggle leaderboard
    - names of students on your kaggle team
- Top 5 scores get 2 bonus points
    - Teams will split their bonus points among team members


Note: Check out the [Kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) which let you make submissions directly from the notebook. Its very similar to using Rivanna's OnDemand in that you can make a RMarkdown/Jupyter notebook or R/Python scrips that run on the cloud. Free CPU (4 cores, 16GB RAM) - amazing! Let your laptops cool off after all their hard work this semester.
