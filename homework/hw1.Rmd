# Problem 1: Evaluating a Regression Model 

## a. Create a set of functions to generate data from the following distributions:
\begin{align*}
X &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\
Y &= -1 + .5X + .2X^2 + \epsilon \\
\epsilon &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, \sigma)
\end{align*}

## b. Simulate $n=100$ realizations from these distributions using $\sigma=3$. Produce a scatterplot and draw the true regression line $f(x) = E[Y \mid X=x]$. 
- Use `set.seed(611)` prior to generating the data.

## c. Fit three polynomial regression models using least squares: linear, quadratic, and cubic. Produce another scatterplot, add the fitted lines and true population line $f(x)$  using different colors, and add a legend that maps the line color to a model.
- Note: The true model is quadratic, but we are also fitting linear (less complex) and cubic (more complex) models.

## d. Simulate a *test data* set of 10,000 observations from the same distributions. Use `set.seed(612)` prior to generating the test data.   
- Calculate the estimated mean squared error (MSE) for each model. 
- Are the results as expected?

## e. What is the best achievable MSE? That is, what is the MSE if the true $f(x)$ was used to evaluate the test set? How close does the best method come to achieving the optimum?

## f. The MSE scores obtained in part *d* came from one realization of training data. Here will we explore how much variation there is in the MSE scores by replicating the simulation many times. 

- Re-run parts b. and c. (i.e., generate training data and fit models) 100 times.
- Calculate the MSE for all simulations. 
- Create kernel density or histogram plots of the resulting MSE values for each model. 
- Use `set.seed(613)` prior to running the simulation and do not set the seed in any other places.
- Use the same test data from part d. (This question is only about the variability that comes from the training data).

## g. Show a count of how many times each model was the best. That is, out of the 100 simulations, count how many times each model had the lowest MSE.

## h. Repeat the simulation in part *f*, but use $\sigma=2$. Report the number of times each model was best (you do not need to produce any plots). Use the same `set.seed(613)` prior to running the simulation and do not set the seed in any other places.

## i. Repeat *h*, but now use $\sigma=4$ and $n=300$.

## j. Describe the effects $\sigma$ and $n$ has on selection of the best model? Why is the *true* model form (i.e., quadratic) not always the *best* model to use when prediction is the goal?
